# Linux Build Instructions

1. Compile [PhysX](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX) with runtime type information.

   After downloading PhysX, remove the `-fno-rtti` flag from the compiler flags in `physx/source/compiler/cmake/linux/CMakeLists.txt`.
   Follow the official build instructions.
   Note that there are dedicated build folders for *release* and *debug*.
   You don't need to install PhysX, we'll use it directly from the build directory.

2. Install the [Vulkan-SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/).

3. Run the following command to install the remaining dependencies.
   Adjust package manager and package names accordingly if you are not using Ubuntu.

       sudo apt install ninja-build pkg-config libassimp-dev libglfw3-dev libopenal-dev libogg-dev libopus-dev libopusfile-dev

4. Run the following commands from the root of this repository to build Raygun.
   Adjust the path to PhysX accordingly.

       cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPhysX_ROOT=$HOME/PhysX -B build
       ninja -C build

5. You can now run the example:

       build/example/example

   Note that Raygun expects the `resources` directory to be located in the current working directory.
